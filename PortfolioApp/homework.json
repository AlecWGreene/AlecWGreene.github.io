The site featues a configuration screen allowing the user to select a difficulty, and the number of questions. From there, the site will assemble a list of questions randomly chosen from 3 different question pools based on the user's chosen difficulty. Each question has a 2:00 minute timer which resets when the user answers the question. The top bar contains a slider, showing the status of each question and allowing the user to view but no re-answer the question. At the end, it will offer to store the user's score, saving it in local storage."

This assignment taught me alot about using 3rd party packages as I learned how to disect the framework to perform custom behaviours."

The app will require the user to be running a MySQL server on localhost, and add a password.txt file to the root directory. Once the setup is complete, the user can run the app. It will automatically setup the tables when the Debug_Seed_SQL script is ran, and to load the sample data the user can run Debug_Seed_Table.sql. <br /> Once the user has the database setup, it's time to go! The user can view the tables, sorting the selected table using 4 different directional criteria (including REGEXP search) with contextual question options using asynchronous calls to the custom built ORM. The user can also update information, answering the prompts to select/enter valid information to send back to the database. The validate database option will fetch the database tables and run a set of rules against them, returning any warnings or errors that the app has found. The app uses a series of asynchronous menu functions which await Inquirer prompts, with nearly each Inquirer prompt utilizing the async features behind its properties to query the database for information to be used in a table display (using a custom build renderer with colors.js), option displays, and input validation. Finally, I built a SQL procedure to reset the department managaers of a specified department, and a SQL function to calculate the salary expenses of a department. "

However, I took an extra step and built an authentication system from scratch which used sha256-js to hash user passwords. A custom built ORM and MySQL procedures allows the app to dynamically create tables where it will store numbers representing the binary hashes of burgers the user has created. Express session stores the user's login status and allows them to mutate their data while enabling the server to block unauthorized users from the burger page. As this was before we covered Sequelize, I had to build the ORM again from scratch to allow these features to function."
