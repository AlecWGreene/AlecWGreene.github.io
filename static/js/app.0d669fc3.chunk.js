I implemented a range slider with dynamically updating feedback, dynamic character set using checkboxes. I also wrote up an algorithm to perform a modified version of the SHA-256 hash algorithm, but it wound up not being a practical solution to the problem."},"04 Code Quiz":{"deployment":"https://alecwgreene.github.io/Assignment-04-Code-Quiz/","repository":"https://github.com/AlecWGreene/Assignment-04-Code-Quiz","contentType":"text","content":"This was my first large scale javascript assignment, which was to create a website using html, javascript, jquery, and css/bootstrap to create a quiz. The site featues a configuration screen allowing the user to select a difficulty, and the number of questions. From there, the site will assemble a list of questions randomly chosen from 3 different question pools based on the user\'s chosen difficulty. Each question has a 2:00 minute timer which resets when the user answers the question. The top bar contains a slider, showing the status of each question and allowing the user to view but no re-answer the question. At the end, it will offer to store the user\'s score, saving it in local storage."},"05 Day Planner":{"deployment":"https://alecwgreene.github.io/Assignment-05-Day-Planner/","repository":"https://github.com/AlecWGreene/Assignment-05-Day-Planner","contentType":"text","content":"Using moment.js, I was given starting css classes and instructed to create a work day planner using JQuery.

I was tasked with creating a Node CLI which would prompt the user for input and assemble a readme for their project. Utilizing the asyn/await syntax, I built a customized Inquirer prompt, which would allow the user to verify text submissions, and see the cumulative result as they typed the next section. This assignment taught me alot about using 3rd party packages as I learned how to disect the framework to perform custom behaviours."},"09 Employee Directory":{"repository":"https://github.com/AlecWGreene/Assignment-09-Employee-Directory","contentType":"text","content":"This assignment was my first exposure to unit testing, using the Jest library. I used inquirer to build another NodeJS CLI, and was more or less building off of the previous homework\'s lessons. I built an app that allowed the user to enter in employee information, getting a live update of the current team as each member\'s information was submitted. Then when the user requests to render, the app will use predefined html templates and output a webpage displaying the team information."},"11 Note Taker":{"deployment":"https://firece-wildwood-75541.herokuapp.com/","repository":"https://github.com/AlecWGreene/Assignment-11-Note-Taker","contentType":"text","content":"Real deployment! Using Heroku.com, I was tasked with creating a note taking app which used a db.json file to store user submitted notes using Express. A substantial amount of starter code was given, although most of it was empty and required me to complete the logic itself. Here I learned how to setup an express server, and handle user requests through routing."},"12 Employee Tracker":{"repository":"https://github.com/AlecWGreene/Assignment-12-Employee-Tracker","contentType":"text","content":"This assignment was my first foray into databases, specifically SQL. Using NodeJS and Inquirer, I built a CLI which allowed complex manipulation of a database. The app will require the user to be running a MySQL server on localhost, and add a password.txt file to the root directory. Once the setup is complete, the user can run the app. It will automatically setup the tables when the Debug_Seed_SQL script is ran, and to load the sample data the user can run Debug_Seed_Table.sql. <br /> Once the user has the database setup, it\'s time to go! The user can view the tables, sorting the selected table using 4 different directional criteria (including REGEXP search) with contextual question options using asynchronous calls to the custom built ORM. The user can also update information, answering the prompts to select/enter valid information to send back to the database. The validate database option will fetch the database tables and run a set of rules against them, returning any warnings or errors that the app has found. The app uses a series of asynchronous menu functions which await Inquirer prompts, with nearly each Inquirer prompt utilizing the async features behind its properties to query the database for information to be used in a table display (using a custom build renderer with colors.js), option displays, and input validation. Finally, I built a SQL procedure to reset the department managaers of a specified department, and a SQL function to calculate the salary expenses of a department.

However, I took an extra step and built an authentication system from scratch which used sha256-js to hash user passwords. A custom built ORM and MySQL procedures allows the app to dynamically create tables where it will store numbers representing the binary hashes of burgers the user has created. Express session stores the user\'s login status and allows them to mutate their data while enabling the server to block unauthorized users from the burger page. As this was before we covered Sequelize, I had to build the ORM again from scratch to allow these features to function."},"17 Fitness Tacker":{"deployment":"https://assignment18workouttracker.herokuapp.com/","repository":"https://github.com/AlecWGreene/Assignment-15-Workout-Tracker","contentType":"text","content":"My first experience with NoSQL languages, in particular MongoDB.

I am a gameplay programmer specializing in AI systems and system design. I am familiar with the Unity and Unreal engines through many courses on Udemy and personal projects. I have been coding since middle school, doing projects in C++, python, C#, and JavaScript. I am a very passionate individual, bringing drive, vision, and dedication to every project I participate in. I am relentless in my pursuit of knowledge and my ambition is only superceded by my persistence.","\n\n","    ","The fall of my eigth grade year, my geometry teacher showed me the website Khan Academemy and encouraged me to seek out the answers to questions I had. This seemingly small moment turned out to be a crucial turning point, as I began to devour the courses. By the end of my eight grade year, I had self taugh myself precalculus and differential calculus, using the MIT open courseware alongside Khan Academy to teach my self integral calculus over the summer. Leading into Freshman year, I fought with the school to allow me to test out of Algebra II, and used my time in precalculues to study my teacher's old college text books. By the end of fall, I had taught myself Multivariable calculus and at the end of the school year was nearly finished with my teacher's differential equations textbook. Concurrently, I was participating in the Michigan Math Mentorship program where I was learning group theory, and had completed a project that my mentor (A post-doc at the University of Michigan) said could be turned into a publication. The last three years of high school, I dual-enrolled at the University of Michigan taking the Math 185 course where I eventually got a written recommendation to be moved up to the Math 296 (Abstract Algebra) course the next semester.","\n\n","  ","During first three years after high school, I learned module-based group representation theory in Oxford, England, partcipated in a 2-person independent study on representation theory at UofM, and during my year at UofM I performed research through the UROP program where I wrote a 14 page paper ",l.a.createElement(m.a,{style:{fontStyle:"italic"}},"On the Approximation of Quatnum using Lattices")," that was submitted to the journal Quantum Information & Computation. After that year, I struggled with some mental health issues due to some life events. When I emerged from this period of my life, I was a little burnt out and lost. However, when I started on the possibility of going into game development, I found my spark again. I have always had an inclination for Game Design; I used to create maps for my brother and I to play in CS:Source using the Hammer SDK, I did the same thing for Age of Mythology, I created different mazes for a month straight in high school to see if I could stump my friend, and I had been playing video games my entire life. I have been playing league of legends on amateur teams for the past 2 years, and have been following the Dev blogs that some of the game developers at Riot write.","\n\n","  ","In the present, I have completed Michigan State's full stack web development bootcamp, and am looking for jobs as a game developer.
